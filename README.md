## üåê Services Covered

### 1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Amazon EC2 provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud. It enables users to run applications on scalable virtual machines with control over security, networking, and storage.

### 2. S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, and security. It's commonly used for storing backups, static websites, and large data files.

### 3. EBS (Elastic Block Store)
EBS provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2. It‚Äôs ideal for databases and applications that require persistent storage with high performance.

### 4. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Amazon VPC allows you to create a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a secure, private network with full control over traffic flow.

### 5. Lambda
AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You only pay for the compute time you consume. Great for event-driven applications and automation.
