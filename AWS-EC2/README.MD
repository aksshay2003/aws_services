# Launching and Connecting to an EC2 Instance on AWS

## Objective

The purpose of this experiment is to establish an AWS account, launch a virtual server (EC2 instance), and connect to it using various methods including the AWS Console and SSH.

## What i Did

- Signed up for an AWS account and selected a basic support plan.
- Accessed the AWS Management Console and navigated to the EC2 Dashboard.
- Launched an EC2 instance using a Free Tier eligible Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
- Configured security settings to allow SSH access.
- Created a key pair for secure authentication and downloaded the PEM file.
- Connected to the EC2 instance using:
  - **Method 1**: EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based).
  - **Method 2**: SSH using PuTTY (after converting the PEM file to PPK).
- Executed basic Linux commands and configured the instance environment.
- Verified server functionality through the AWS Console and terminal output.

## Key Concepts Practiced

- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) basics
- Instance types and AMIs
- SSH key pair management
- Terminal operations and server-side configurations
- Secure remote access

## Outcome

Successfully created and connected to a cloud-based virtual machine and practiced essential Linux commands and setup procedures inside a live cloud environment.
